# pokerGameOn
The pokerGameOn is designed based on BlackJack.

The rules of game are: 
(1) Except for A, other cards' values equal with their face values, e.g. "J" = 11, "Q" = 12, "K" = 13, "2" = 2, "3" = 3.
(2) Each player is delt with a hand of cards. 
(3) If a hand's value is larger than 21, then "A" = 1; otherwise, "A" = 14. 
(4) The player whose hand's value is larger wins. But if a player's hand's value exceeds 21, he/she loses, while the other player wins. 
(5) When given the chance to be delt a new card, the player can decide if he/she is going to get a new card.
(6) Cards' suits do not matter here.

Several versions of the game are provided: (1) one human player vs. one computer player (2) two human players.

For the first version, go to the file "humanVersusComputer"; for the second, go to "humanVersusHuman" (still under progress).
